An address book application.

# Configuration:
Start by cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter.git <your-frontend-project-name>
```

The project uses Grunt to run tasks in development. Thoroughly review our [resource on using Grunt](https://www.bloc.io/resources/using-grunt) before using this application. It may also help to review [our resource on NPM and `package.json` files](https://www.bloc.io/resources/npm-and-package-json).

Install the project dependencies by running:

```
$ npm install
```

## Run the Application

Run the application using the Gruntfile's `default` task:

```
$ grunt
```

The default task runs a simple server on port 3000. To view it in a any browser, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

>Note that unless the application is run [via Live Preview in Brackets](#use-in-brackets-live-preview), the browser will need to be refreshed to view the most recent changes.

## Use in Brackets Live Preview

To use the application with the Live Preview functionality of the Brackets text editor, go to __File > Project Settings__ and add `http://localhost:3000` to the Base URL field.
